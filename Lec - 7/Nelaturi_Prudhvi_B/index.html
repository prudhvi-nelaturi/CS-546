      <h2>Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania</h2>
      <p>
        So, this last spring I went to Pocono Mountains for trailing and it
        was so amazing. We along with 5 other friends rented a house from
        VRBO, a car from Enterprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a two days trip. We went to Jim Thorpe, Stone Park, VineYard in
        Pennsylvania. We did hiking in one of trails where we followed the
        water flow in the woods.

      <h2>Visiting Family and Friends</h2>
      <p>
        Although we have numerous dream destinations, Home is the ultimate
        destinations of all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone dreams of going home after doing whatever the
        tasks/accomplishments.For many people, traveling to visit family and
        friends makes their loved ones' homes a primary travel destination.
        These visits are often more about spending time with people than
        exploring a new location.

      <h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
      <p>
        Niagara Falls is one of the most famous and spectacular natural
        wonders in the world.

        I went to Niagara in the last summer. The trip was amazing from ride
        to the falls. We clicked lots of pictures, tried different food.
